# ADR 05: Adoption of Flask-SQLAlchemy for Object-Relational Mapping

## Description

This document outlines the decision to adopt Flask-SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for our Flask-based application. It provides context, rationale, consequences, and the accepted status of the decision.

## Context

Our application requires a robust and efficient mechanism for interacting with a relational database. The decision-making team is evaluating ORM solutions to streamline database operations, enhance maintainability, and improve the overall development experience.

## Decision

After careful consideration, the decision has been made to adopt Flask-SQLAlchemy as the ORM tool for our Flask-based application.

## Rationale

1. **Integration with Flask:**
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy is specifically designed for Flask applications, providing seamless integration with the Flask ecosystem. This simplifies configuration and enhances compatibility.

2. **Declarative Model Definitions:**
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy allows us to define database models using a declarative syntax, making it more intuitive and readable. This reduces boilerplate code and enhances code maintainability.

3. **SQLAlchemy Flexibility:**
   - Leveraging SQLAlchemy as the underlying ORM engine provides flexibility in terms of raw SQL queries, enabling complex database operations when needed.

4. **Built-in Query Support:**
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a powerful query interface, allowing developers to express database queries using a high-level, Pythonic syntax. This promotes code readability and ease of development.

5. **Migration Support:**
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy integrates seamlessly with Alembic, offering robust database migration support. This facilitates schema changes over time without manual intervention.

6. **Active Community and Documentation:**
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy has an active community and extensive documentation, providing valuable resources for troubleshooting, best practices, and continuous learning.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

While adopting Flask-SQLAlchemy brings numerous benefits, it's important to consider potential consequences:

1. **Learning Curve:**
   - Team members who are new to Flask-SQLAlchemy may experience a learning curve. Adequate training and documentation will be provided to ensure a smooth transition.

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Regular updates and compatibility checks with Flask versions will be necessary to manage dependencies effectively.

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - While Flask-SQLAlchemy provides good performance out of the box, careful consideration must be given to database indexing, query optimization, and other performance-related factors as the application scales.

## Conclusion

The decision to adopt Flask-SQLAlchemy as the ORM tool is accepted, recognizing its alignment with Flask, flexibility, and support for declarative model definitions. The team will actively manage the identified consequences and leverage the benefits of Flask-SQLAlchemy to streamline database interactions in our application.
