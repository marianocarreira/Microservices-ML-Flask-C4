# ADR 01: Adoption of Microservices Architecture

## Description

This document outlines the decision to adopt the microservices architecture style for our system, explaining the context, rationale, consequences, and the accepted status of the decision.

## Context

Do a recognized potentiall increment on business growth and system's demand.

## Decision

After careful consideration, the decision has been made to adopt the microservices architecture style for our system.

## Rationale

1. **Scalability:**
   - Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of services, ensuring efficient resource utilization based on specific service requirements.

2. **Agility and Continuous Delivery:**
   - Microservices enable independent development and deployment, facilitating faster release cycles and quicker adaptation to changing business needs.

3. **Fault Isolation:**
   - Isolating services in a microservices architecture prevents a failure in one service from impacting the entire system, enhancing overall system resilience.

4. **Technology Diversity:**
   - Microservices permit the use of different technologies for each service, allowing teams to choose the most suitable tools for their specific functionalities.

5. **Autonomous Teams:**
   - Microservices encourage the formation of autonomous teams, fostering ownership and accountability for the development and maintenance of individual services.

6. **Easier Maintenance and Upgrades:**
   - The modular nature of microservices simplifies maintenance and upgrades, allowing changes to one service without affecting others.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

While adopting the microservices architecture brings numerous benefits, it's important to consider potential consequences:

1. **Increased Complexity:**
   - Managing a distributed system introduces additional complexity in terms of communication, monitoring, and data consistency.

2. **Operational Overhead:**
   - Operating and monitoring multiple services require robust infrastructure and operational practices to ensure system reliability.

3. **Data Consistency Challenges:**
   - Maintaining consistency across distributed data in a microservices architecture may require additional efforts and careful design considerations.

## Conclusion

The decision to adopt the microservices architecture is accepted, recognizing its potential to address our current challenges and provide a more scalable and agile foundation for our system. The team will actively manage and mitigate the identified consequences throughout the implementation process.
